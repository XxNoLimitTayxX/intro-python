# - allows your reader to see where you got your information from.
# - gives credit to the people and organizations that have done the research.
# - protects the writer from claims of plagarizing their work. 

# MLA is written as followed:
# full name of the author, title of article/ video, date article was published, 
# website link for article/video

# Python coding makes one of the most popular games, The Sims, even better than it already is! 
# Python is the base coding method for the SIms 4. Which is a interactive simulation based game. On the other side, 
# Python is a popular programming language, and it's used for creating games, programs, apps, and more! They are also
# creators of one of the most popular games of the last decade.

# It's like the secret sauce that makes everything happen. When you tell your Sim to dance, or eat a plate of grilled
# cheese, Python is the one that makes sure your Sim gets up and does it. It's like the puppet master behind the 
# curtain, making sure all the Sims in the game do their thing. Python also helps with mods and custom content. 
# Modders, who are basically extremely talented fans of the game, use Python to create amazing stuff. They can make new 
# clothes, furniture, or even whole new worlds for your Sims to explore. Python is like the magic wand that makes 
# their ideas come to life.

# You don't have to be the best when it comes to computer science to understand Python and how it works with Sims.
