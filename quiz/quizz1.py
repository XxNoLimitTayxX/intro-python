# 5. You have been given a $100.00 dollar gift card from a family member. Another

# Your task is to create variables for each gift amount and a final variable that

moneyFromFam1 = 100
moneyFromFam2 = 50
moneyFromFam3 = 35

totalAmounrOfMoney = 185

# 6. Create a variable that uses the input function and then print that variable. Your variable

userName = imput("What is your name?")

# 7. You have been asked to create a program for a community center that wants to plan a cookout. 
# The community center wants you to build a form program and capture several key data points. 
# They want to know a visitor's full name, their age, if they have an allergy, and what their 
# favorite food is. You need to create the appropriate varialbes with the appropriate data type
# and use the input() function and print function to take in and print out the user's responses.

# have an allergy they can eat the regular bread. What data type would best be used in this 
# scenario and how would you write a variable to represent this value?
