# Project Prompt Assignment
For todays assignment you will begin brainstorming your python program project.
For now, take what we've discussed and learned about the design process to develop a program idea.

Your file name should be yourName_projectPrompt.md

ex. iank_projectPrompt.md

Your file should be formatted as an MD file. Similar to the assignment from yesterday.

# About your project
You will design and develop your very own orginal program application. Your program should take in a user's input or commands, perform at least three (3) different types of functionality on the user input data, and then out put some type of data. 

(By functionality, it should be able to do any of the things we've learned in class such as loops, conditionals, data casting, etc. )

**DO NOT PUT LIMITS ON YOURSELF OR WHAT YOU CAN DEVELOP**
whatever you elect to design, you can do it with Python.

# Answer the following questions

1. What is your program about? What problem are you trying to solve?

I am attempting to create a non human contact drive-thru so that people who are antisocial or just don't
feel like talking could easily order food and go on with their day.

2. What are three (3) things your program is going to do?

1: Help antisocial people
2: Limits cost of paying for cashiers and people to work for the FFR.
3: Limit the need for customer service.

3. Are there any programs that exist that does somthing similar to your program?

I believe something like wawa has touchscreen orders for things but nothing like drive thru.

4. What is your project MVP (minimum viable product)? What is the most basic peices of code
you need to write to get your projected started and working?
 Simple functions like print, def, and setting variables.


**Extra Credit**
# Design
Imagine your program is running on a mobile phone, develop a wireframe of what it will 
look like when it is running.

You can draw these out with pen and paper, take a picture, and attach it to this markdown document. 
If you don't know how, do some research to figure out how to upload a picture.
