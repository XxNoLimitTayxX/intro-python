# Project Review

1. <b>What inspired you (or your team) to develop this program?</b>

I was inspired to develop this program by the sheer committment I have to make everything I do that is considered a project is perfect.

2. <b>What was a road block that you had with writing your program? How did you solve your  problem?</b>

there were a few raod blocks that came up during the development of this program. They were figuring out the errors that I couldn't understand. Also getting numbers to appear when making transactions. 

3. <b>What is somthing you would have liked to have added or done differently?</b>

If I had more time, I would have created a program that allows people to send money to other users and a proper error code. 





















1. user types in a website
2. gives user the option to choose where they want there ip to be
3. the program generates an ip for that country they chosen 
4. then the program warns them that there is a virus for this ip, and ask if they want to switch location, and or ip
5. if the still enter the website the program will block off pop-up ads with viruses 
6. if the user almost ends up with a virus, the program will indefinitely warn the user they caught a virus until the user exits out the website
